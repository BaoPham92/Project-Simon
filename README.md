# Project-Simon

techologies: 

So in this project, I attempted to take the approach of using two outside methods in implementing code. 

1. Canvas.

2. Animations. (sprite sheet animations.)

Approach:

I had had chosen to use the canvas and animations as a duo combo. I didn't make step by step plans as I wanted to make sure that I was able to setup a base mainframe of the two.

Installation:

1. Motio CDN //This was a claimed stable version until I had fallouts near the end.

2. JQuery CDN

3. Script.js tag

4. Animation.js tag

Unsolved problems:

1. Level sequence.

2. Had a working canvas initiation with a workable template. Canvas was aborted seeing as mountains of implemtations occured with the CDN library of motio near the end, as well as tools to design the canvas. 

3. Implementations of extra classes for the animations halted due to library errors of Motio. 

4. Failed to recognize targetable objects for incrementing custom properties from Motio. "FPS" and "Frames"
