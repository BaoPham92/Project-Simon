Feedback:
Mostly my JQuery in js. I feel like I could have made cleaner code, especially when trying to grab classes from the chest animations.

DRY code is there. Last minute hurdle to recoup lost structure. Although for the JQuery I believe there are cleaner ways to write them. I think I could have a loop to iterate them through a function if I put them in an object then object in array.

> Can you point me to specific lines you'd like feedback on and what your questions about it are? Generally, I'd say your code could be a little more organized. It's  a little hard to read with the unusual formatting and you have a lot of commented out code in there that shouldn't be on the main branch of an application. Also, `document.ready` shouldn't be inside a function. That should encompass all your code. Little confused by the `animation.js` file. Is there a reason it's in vanilla JS? Could this have been in your main `script.js` file?

## Creativity and Interface

**3: Excelling**
> The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS. Some instructions guiding the user on how to play would be helpful. Took me a minute to figure out what was going on. Also, I'd style the buttons. The default look isn't great. That said, the animations are cool!.
